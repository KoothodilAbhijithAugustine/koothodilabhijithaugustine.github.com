# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am doing a PhD in Astronomy from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan. 
  My advisor is Prof. Hsiang-Kuang Chang. I am doing a long term study of The Crab using Swift-BAT. 
  I am also working on the simulation of minimum detectable polarization, of custom made CubeSats models by our group, using MEGAlib.
