Welcome to the personal website of Koothodil Abhijith Augustine. I am doing a PhD in Astronomy from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan.
My advisor is Prof. Hsiang-Kuang Chang. I am doing a long term study of The Crab using Swift-BAT. 
I am also working on the simulation of minimum detectable polarization, of custom made CubeSats models by our group, using MEGAlib.
